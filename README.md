# find-four
Find Four / Connect Four written in Python.

Uses a similar frame to my tic-tac-toe board but uses a search algorithm to find every single possible array of four (horizontally, vertically, diagonally and anti-diagonals as well.
The game is also infinite until someone 'connects four' or the amount of possible moves is zero.
